# FEEDR
FEEDR is an application we created as the project for our second semester Java programming course. But it turned out so much more than that. FEEDR is an application created for the good cause of distributing food wasted in colleges and distribute it to NGO's. It helped us learn a lot about development in a team. The developers who contributed are:-<br />
1)Aayush Gupta  @aayushcodes<br />
2)Akash Sinha   @theskysinha<br />
3)Khushi Tomar  @KhushiTomar25<br />
4)Parkhi Saini  @ParkhiSaini<br />
